# Alzheimer-s-disease-prediction-using-ML-algorithms
This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate prediction system for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using machine learning algorithms. Alzheimer’s is a neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs memory and cognitive function. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and care, making machine learning a valuable tool in automating detection.

How It Works:

The system utilizes various machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of Alzheimer’s disease. The key steps involved are:

Data Collection – Acquiring datasets from medical sources that include MRI scans, genetic markers, clinical history, and cognitive test results.

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and normalizing data to remove inconsistencies and enhance model accuracy.

Feature Selection – Identifying key attributes that contribute most to the diagnosis, such as brain imaging features and biomarker data.

Model Training – Implementing and training machine learning algorithms such as:
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Deep Learning (CNN for image-based analysis)
Model Evaluation – Assessing performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction and Diagnosis – Deploying the model to analyze new patient data and predict Alzheimer's risk.

What the Project Does
This project is dedicated to raising awareness, providing support, and advancing knowledge about Alzheimer’s disease. It explores various aspects of the condition, including early detection, treatment options, caregiving strategies, and ongoing research. The project aims to be a comprehensive resource for patients, caregivers, and researchers, offering valuable insights and practical solutions to improve the quality of life for those affected by Alzheimer’s.
